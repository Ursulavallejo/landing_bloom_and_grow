## Project Concept & Design

The visual layout and structure of the website are intentionally designed to reflect the core idea of the project:

- **Families & children first** — friendly, warm, and non-intimidating
- **Playful but structured** — clear hierarchy without feeling rigid
- **Emotion-driven design** — colors, shapes, and motion support emotional expression

### Visual language

- **Vibrant and soft color palette** to communicate joy, safety, and creativity
- **Rounded shapes and organic blobs** inspired by children’s illustration styles
- **Large typography and generous spacing** to improve readability
- **Subtle animations** used as emotional guidance, not decoration

Motion and interaction are intentionally minimal and respectful of accessibility preferences.

## Accessibility & Motion

Accessibility is a core part of this project:

- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper ARIA attributes where needed
- Keyboard navigable UI
- Decorative elements marked as `aria-hidden`
- Focus styles carefully controlled to avoid visual noise

Animations automatically disable for users who prefer reduced motion.
